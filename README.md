## Usage
CinoLib is header only, it does not not need to be installed, all you have to do is to include in your C++ application the header files you need. A tutorial with detailed info on how to use the library is under developement. In the meanwhile, you might refer to the **/examples** folder, which contains a number of sample projects that showcase the core features of the library and will be the backbone of the forthcoming tutorial.
