- refactor connectivity editing throughout  the library. Trimesh should have three methods
  edge_collapse(), triangle_split(), edge_split(), and all the connectivity changes should
  happen through these operators!
- add max_depth to Profiler to avoid lengthy reports
- Think about it: you don’t need a tree for the profiler. If you put all the ProfilerEntries into a list sorted by time of call you did it…
- topology navigation should happen always through adj_x2y methods. Explicitly stored
   connectivity should be invisible from the outside… 
- refactor IsoCurve (exploiting the Curve class)
- extend the concept of subdivisions from hexmesh to any mesh
- make cotangent weights robust against almost degenerate triangles and boundary meshes
- add Additive Manufacturing stuff (load and process CLI files)…
- transform any function containing inner Trimesh<> or Tetmesh<> into a templated function  with generic Mesh type
- Improve face tessellation strategy for polygonal meshes (flipped elements may currently arise for non convex polygons)
- Add cylinder and spheres list (with colors, size and so forth) in the render list used for meshes, so that there will be only on unified rendering access point
- Refactor PointInsideMeshCache, it should return ALL the elements containing the
  query point and let the application choose the best one
- make a DrawableOctree (and visually test the octree)
- Bake a CurveNetwork class and use it for skeletons, gestures, sharp features 
  and coarse layouts
- Add cache for eigen solvers - avoid refactoring matrices multiple times
- Use robust geometric computations (volumes, dihedral angles ecc.) 
  (ref. => Lecture Notes on Geometric Robustness di Jonathan Richard Shewchuk)
- Add cotan laplacian  normalization
  (ref => https://www.ceremade.dauphine.fr/~peyre/teaching/manifold/tp4.html)
- Add ambient occlusion (with/without floor)
- Copy/paste points of view
- remove dependency from libQGLViewer and use GLFW instead
- Improve on mesh rendering (shaders, VBOs)
- Add text box with debug messages
- Fix Logger (it does not flush the streaming buffer until the program is closed)
