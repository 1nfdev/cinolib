This folder contains a number of sample programs that illustrate the functionalities of cinolib. 

At the moment the amount of sample programs is very limited. I am currently working on a wide number of code samples that heavily exploit cinolib and will be available in the following weeks. All of these topics will be covered:

* Using customized mesh/vertex/edge/polygon/polyhedron attributes
* Generation processing and visualization of scalar fields
* Generation processing and visualization of vector fields
* Generation of poly-harmonic functions for surfaces and volumes
* Illustration of the topology editing operators implemented in cinolib
* Computation of quality metrics and mapping distortions
* Computation of conformal maps for surface meshes
* Computation of heat based geodesics for surfaces and volumes
* Format converters
* Triangulation of general planar domains using Triangle
* Tetrahedralization of PLCs using Tetgen
* Solving multi-labeling problems on surfaces and volumes using GraphCuts
* Using dualization to generate general polygonal and polyhedral meshes
* Using conformalized heat flow to map genus zero surfaces to a sphere
* Integral curve computation (with tessellation)
* Iso curve computation (with tessellation)
* Subdivision schemas for hexahedral meshes
* Sampling the sphere using spherical Fibonacci

and much more!
