This folder contains a number of sample programs that illustrate the functionalities of cinolib. 

Unfortunately maintaining a library alone is very time consuming, and the amount of time I can spend on it is limited. At the moment the number of sample programs is very limited. 

I am currently working on a wide number of code samples that exploit the core functionalities of cinolib. They should be available in the following weeks. All of these topics will be covered:

* Customize data structures with user defined mesh/vertex/edge/polygon/polyhedron attributes
* Generate, process and visualize scalar fields
* Generate, process and visualize vector fields
* Generate poly-harmonic functions for surfaces and volumes
* Overview of the topology editing operators implemented in cinolib
* Computation of quality metrics and mapping distortions
* Computation of conformal maps for surface meshes
* Computation of heat based geodesics for surfaces and volumes
* Surface and volumetric format converters
* Triangulation of general planar domains using Triangle
* Tetrahedralization of piece-wise linear complexes using Tetgen
* Solve multi-labeling problems on surfaces and volumes using GraphCuts
* Exploit dualization to generate general polygonal and polyhedral meshes
* Use conformalized heat flow to map genus zero surfaces to a sphere
* Integral curve computation (and tessellation)
* Iso curve computation (and tessellation)
* Subdivision schemas for hexahedral meshes
* Uniform sphere sampling using spherical Fibonacci

and much more!
